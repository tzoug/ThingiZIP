ThingiZIP is a web browser extension that makes it easy to download images and files from Thingiverse™. This extension creates an interactive popup in the toolbar of your browser. This project utilizes the Thingiverse™ API. Please note that if the Thingiverse™ API changes, the performance and/or functionality of this extension may be impacted.

## Usage

To download a ZIP file, you must be on a valid Thingiverse™ model page.  
Here is an example of the structure of a valid page: `https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1234567`  

As you can see, a valid page contains a series of numbers preceded by `thing:`  
It doesn't matter if there's anything after the numbers.  
For example, `https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1234567/files` is also a valid page.  

### Home Page

This is where you will be able to download and view information about the last Thingiverse page you visited.

You can either:
- Download Files: only download the files (`.stl`, `.obj`, `.gcode`... )
- Download All: download the files + images + `details.txt`

### Recents

This is where you will see a history of the previous Thingiverse page that you visited.

Note that information only gets added to the recents whenever you open the extension on a Thingiverse page.
In other words, if you visit a number of pages without opening the extension popup, they will not be added to the recents.
